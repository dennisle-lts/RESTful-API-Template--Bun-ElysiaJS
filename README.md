# RESTful API Template with Bun & ElysiaJS

## Overview
This template has nearly everything you will need to start developing a new RESTful API with Bun runtime. At the time of creating this template, ElysiaJS is the framework that has the best performance and is optimized for Bun runtime. One of the key features that made me choose this framework is that it has auto-generated OpenAPI definitions, and the performance is really good with Bun runtime.

This template provides a solid foundation for building production-ready APIs with modern tooling and best practices. It includes essential features such as request validation, error handling, and API documentation out of the box. Whether you're building a small microservice or a large-scale application, this template helps you get started quickly without sacrificing code quality or performance.

The combination of Bun's blazing-fast runtime and ElysiaJS's lightweight architecture ensures that your API can handle high throughput with minimal latency. The template is designed to be easily extensible, allowing you to add custom middleware, plugins, and routes as your project grows.
